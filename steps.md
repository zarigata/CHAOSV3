Step 1: Review Existing UI

Clone the CHAOSV3 repository.

Identify and remove unnecessary files from the FRONTEND directory.

Set up the development environment and run the existing UI to understand its current state.

Step 2: Define Backend Requirements

List all necessary APIs for chat functionality, user management, and media handling.

Choose a backend framework supported by AI code builders (e.g., Express for Node.js or FastAPI for Python).

Design the database schema for users, messages, and channels.

Step 3: Develop Backend Services

Implement RESTful APIs for authentication, messaging, and user profiles.

Set up WebSocket connections for real-time communication.

Integrate media services for voice, video, and screen sharing.

Step 4: Integrate Frontend with Backend

Connect the existing TypeScript UI to the backend APIs.

Implement state management for real-time updates.

Ensure responsive design and user-friendly interfaces.

Step 5: Dockerize the Application

Create Dockerfiles for both frontend and backend services.

Set up Docker Compose for orchestrating multi-container deployments.

Test the Dockerized application locally and document the setup process.

Step 6: Build Standalone Executable

Integrate Electron to wrap the web application into a desktop application.

Configure build scripts to generate a Windows executable (.exe).

Test the standalone application for performance and stability.

Step 7: Deployment and Hosting

Set up an official server for hosting the application.

Provide documentation for users to self-host using Docker.

Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
