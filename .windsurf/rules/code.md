## AI Code Builder Guidelines

1. **Utilize the Highest Quality Resources**  
   Grade and select the best available gold-standard components â€” those with **no flaws or defects**. Employ the **most advanced techniques** currently known and available at the best achievable resolution.

2. **Leverage the Most Reliable Technologies**  
   Use the **most stable and up-to-date versions** of technologies that you are fully proficient with. Prioritize **versions with the least reported bugs or vulnerabilities**.

3. **Strictly Follow Project Documentation**  
   Adhere closely to the instructions provided in both `project.md` and `steps.md`. These documents are the **authoritative source of truth** for this project.

4. **Handle Deviations Proactively**  
   If a **deviation or inconsistency** is detected, immediately pause progress. Then:
   - Re-read **all relevant files** (`project.md`, `steps.md`, and others as needed).
   - Verify all required conditions and constraints are properly met before proceeding.
